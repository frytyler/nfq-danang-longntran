# NFQ LongTran

This is very simple project but I structure and apply some advanced techniques to make ability scale up

## Development server

Run `npm run start or yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.
